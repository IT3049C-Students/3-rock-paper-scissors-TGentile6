## Self-Evaluation: 
how many points out of 20 does your team deserve on this assignment. Revise the assignment grading guideline and assignment rubrics for guidance.
I would say this assignment is worth a 17/20. I completed all aspects to the best of my ability however the site does not function as intended.

## Team Reflection:
- Where did you encounter struggles today, and what did you do to deal with it?
I didn't have any issues with this assignment until the game controller section, I was unable to get the site to properly function and I could not figure out why it wasn't working.
To my knowledge I was following the instructions correctly and I tried to find solutions by checking the documentation of JS and HTML, but I couldn't figure out what was causing my issue.

### How long it took us to finish this?
approximately 2 hours.
